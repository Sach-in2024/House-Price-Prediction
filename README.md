# 🏠 House Price Prediction (Kaggle Competition)

This project is my solution for the Kaggle competition **"House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques"**.  
The goal is to predict the final price of each home in the test dataset using various features.

## 📌 About the Project

- 📊 Built a machine learning regression model to predict house prices.
- 🧠 Used advanced models like **XGBoost**, **LightGBM**, and **CatBoost** for better accuracy.
- 🧼 Performed thorough data preprocessing: missing value imputation, outlier removal, and feature engineering.
- 🧪 Evaluated models using **Cross-Validation (KFold)** and optimized using **Root Mean Squared Log Error (RMSLE)**.

## 🏅 Achievements

- ✅ Kaggle Public Leaderboard Rank: **435 / 4806**
- ✅ Score: **0.12148**
- 🚀 Completed within a day as my **second ML project**, making it a special learning milestone!

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python (Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab)
- Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost

## 📂 Files

- `house_price_prediction.ipynb` – Main notebook with the full pipeline
- `README.md` – You are here!

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Add automated hyperparameter tuning
- Try deep learning models (like TabNet or MLP)
- Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit
